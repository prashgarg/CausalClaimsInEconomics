For example:\n         - Experimental Approaches: RCT, Field Experiments, Lab Experiments\n         - Quasi-Experimental Methods: DID, RDD/RKD, IV, LATE, Natural Experiments, Matching (e.g., Propensity Score Matching)\n         - Panel Data Methods: Fixed Effects (One-Way, Two-Way), Dynamic Panel Models (Arellano-Bond, System GMM)\n         - Structural/Simulation Methods: Structural Estimation, CGE Models, Agent-Based Models\n         - Time Series & Macroeconometric Methods: VAR, SVAR, Event Studies\n         - Modern/Machine Learning Methods: Causal Forests, Double/Debiased ML, TMLE, Bayesian Methods\n         - Specialized Methods: Control Function, Heckman Correction, Sample Selection, Quantile Regression, Nonparametric/Semiparametric, Meta-Analysis\n    - Effect size and direction (including magnitude if stated).\n    - Statistical significance (and details on any null results).\n    - Level of tentativeness in the language used.\n- Indicate which parts derive from explicit causal identification and which from correlational or theoretical analyses.\nDo not truncate details; be as exhaustive as possible."
